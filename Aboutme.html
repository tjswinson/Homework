        <p> <h4> Welcome to my world! My name is Tiffany Swinson. I was born in Georgia and raised in New Jersey so I consider myself a Jersey Peach. <br>
            I'm currently an analyst for a forestry management company. I enjoy traveling, shopping,  diy projects around the house and spending time with my furkids.
       <br> My favorite is any beach with beautiful sand and water. </h4>
